Need to practice:

1. Find the common sequences of purchases in a dataset containing information in the following form:
	type record struct {
		userId string
		itemId string
		timestamp time.Time
	}

	first, sort dataset by user, then by item, then (somehow) find all the item sequences in the sorted dataset
		Suffix tree?
		Hashmap


2. Solid understanding of directed and undirect graph cycle detection
	topological sort
