Need to practice:

1. Find the common sequences of purchases in a dataset containing information in the following form:
	type record struct {
		userId string
		itemId string
		timestamp time.Time
	}

	first, sort dataset by user, then by item, then (somehow) find all the item sequences in the sorted dataset
		Suffix tree?
		Hashmap


2. Solid understanding of directed and undirected graph cycle detection
	Topological sort - does the straightforward algo apply to undirected graphs?
	Let's compute cycles in cname records


3. HashMap implementation using only arrays

4. Dynamic programming and optimization problems
	Knapsack anyone?
	Longest common subsequence
	Know how to recognize these types of problems and how to quickly implement a solution
